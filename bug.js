This error occurs when using Expo CLI and attempting to run the application on a device or emulator. The application might start, but certain functionalities might not work as expected. This often happens due to misconfigurations in the project's `app.json` or `expo.json` files, missing dependencies, or issues with the device's connection to the development server.
