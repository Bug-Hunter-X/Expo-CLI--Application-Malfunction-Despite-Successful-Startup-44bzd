# Expo CLI: Application Malfunction Despite Successful Startup

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Expo CLI. The application appears to start successfully on a device or emulator, but some functionalities fail to work correctly.

## Bug Description
The main issue is that despite the app seemingly launching without errors, key features may be broken, often related to asynchronous operations, native modules, or interactions with device hardware.  This error is subtle and may not be immediately apparent in the console logs.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the malfunctioning features on the device/emulator.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves careful examination of the `app.json` or `expo.json` file for misconfigurations, checking for missing or incorrect dependencies, and verifying the integrity of the device connection.  Furthermore, comprehensive debugging of the application's logic, particularly asynchronous parts, is vital.
