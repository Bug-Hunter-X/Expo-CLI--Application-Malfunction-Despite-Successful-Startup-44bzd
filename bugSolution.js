The solution usually involves a combination of several steps:

1. **Check `app.json`/`expo.json`:** Verify that all configurations in the project's configuration files are correct. Ensure there are no typos or inconsistencies that might be causing issues.
2. **Verify Dependencies:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that no version conflicts exist. Re-install all packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. If you're using native modules, double check they are correctly linked.
3. **Examine Device Connection:** Make sure your device or emulator is properly connected to the development server and that the IP address and port specified in your Expo config are correct.  Try restarting both the device/emulator and the development server.
4. **Thorough Debugging:** Use the Expo developer tools and implement appropriate logging statements in your code. Pay special attention to asynchronous operations and potential race conditions. Employ a debugger to track the program flow and identify the exact points of failure.
5. **Check for Native Module Issues:** If you're using native modules, ensure that they're configured correctly and linked properly. Review native module documentation for any platform-specific requirements or limitations.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:** In some cases, a clean build may resolve the problem. Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies.
7. **Update Expo:** Make sure your expo-cli and project dependencies are up to date by running `expo upgrade`.
